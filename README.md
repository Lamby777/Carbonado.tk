# Carbonado.tk
This repo is only the code for the website, not the currency itself.  
You might be looking for
[this](https://github.com/Lamby777/Carbonado-coin).

## So, what do I do?
If you for some reason want to add to the website, feel free to open a
pull request, but I probably won't accept it anyway.
This is my first time using Bootstrap on one of my sites
instead of regular CSS or LESS, and I want to learn it without code
dumping. Feel free to open a pull request for the actual coin (if you
know NodeJS), though.
